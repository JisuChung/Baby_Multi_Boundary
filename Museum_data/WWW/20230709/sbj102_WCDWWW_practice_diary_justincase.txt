PTB-INFO There are still 13822 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO a total of 104 times out of a total of 2892 flips during this session.

INFO This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentationPsychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2).
WARNING This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real
WARNING study, please make sure to set Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 0) for maximum accuracy and reliability.

PTB-INFO Proper timing and timestamping of visual stimulus onset is not reliably supported at all
PTB-INFO when running in windowed mode (non-fullscreen). If PTB aborts with 'Synchronization failure'
PTB-INFO you can disable the sync test via call to Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2); .
PTB-INFO You won't get proper stimulus onset timestamps in any case though, so windowed mode is of limited use.


PTB-INFO OpenGL-Renderer is NVIDIA Corporation  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 TiPCIeSSE2  4.6.0 NVIDIA 512.89
PTB-INFO VBL startline = 1080 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback.
PTB-INFO Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be therefore less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 0.000000 ms [inf Hz]. (0 valid samples taken, stddev=0.000000 ms.)

PTB-INFO There are still 853 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO a total of 159 times out of a total of 3613 flips during this session.

INFO This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentationPsychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2).
WARNING This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real
WARNING study, please make sure to set Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 0) for maximum accuracy and reliability.

PTB-INFO There are still 11943 textures, offscreen windows or proxy windows open. Screen('CloseAll') will auto-close them.
PTB-INFO This may be fine for studies where you only use a few textures or windows, but a large number of open
PTB-INFO textures or offscreen windows can be an indication that you forgot to dispose no longer needed items
PTB-INFO via a proper call to Screen('Close', [windowOrTextureIndex]); , e.g., at the end of each trial. These
PTB-INFO stale objects linger around and can consume significant memory ressources, causing degraded performance,
PTB-INFO timing trouble (if the system has to resort to disk paging) and ultimately out of memory conditions or
PTB-INFO crashes. Please check your code. (Screen('Close') is a quick way to release all textures and offscreen windows)



INFO PTB's Screen('Flip', 10) command seems to have missed the requested stimulus presentation deadline
INFO a total of 6916 times out of a total of 21982 flips during this session.

INFO This number is fairly accurate (and indicative of real timing problems in your own code or your system)
INFO if you provided requested stimulus onset times with the 'when' argument of Screen('Flip', window [, when]);
INFO If you called Screen('Flip', window); without the 'when' argument, this count is more of a ''mild'' indicator
INFO of timing behaviour than a hard reliable measurement. Large numbers may indicate problems and should at least
INFO deserve your closer attention. Cfe. 'help SyncTrouble', the FAQ section at www.psychtoolbox.org and the
INFO examples in the PDF presentation in PsychDocumentationPsychtoolbox3-Slides.pdf for more info and timing tips.



WARNING This session of your experiment was run by you with the setting Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 2).
WARNING This means that some internal self-tests and calibrations were skipped. Your stimulus presentation timing
WARNING may have been wrong. This is fine for development and debugging of your experiment, but for running the real
WARNING study, please make sure to set Screen('Preference', 'SkipSyncTests', 0) for maximum accuracy and reliability.
